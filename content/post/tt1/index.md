You can order your book menus in three ways:

By title ascending
By title descending
By manual ordering using weight: 10 in the front matter of pages, where the number defines the order
users recommend using weights that are increments of 10 so that itâ€™s easy to reorder a page in the future without needing to change the weight of all the other pages
